# Faunal Assmblage Data Tool

This program is intended for the creation of archaeological catalogs containing data of faunal assemblages. 

# Description

This is intended for organizing data, specifically, of faunal remains. The initial idea for the program was to create an easier method for excavation data organization. The data tool uses 
SQlite3 to create tables of individual specimen data. Data includes; catalog numbers, specimen type, taxon, species, estimated age, etc. All of the inputted data is organized sufficiently to 
aid in analysis of specimens and arrangement of collections.

# Utilization

This is a very simple Python program to run. For the table outputs the SQLite Database browser tool was used (https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/). 

# Notes

The idea came from my experience in working with archaeological collections and how archaic the methods for catalogging collections were. 
The goal is to replace the tedious creation of messy excel sheets with a simple Python program that can create the tables for you.  This is my first finished Python program, as a 
coding beginner it seemed like a good way to farmiliarize myself with SQLite.
